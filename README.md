# End-to-end testing with Selenium

This is a **demo** project to showcase how to perform End-To-End testing using the `Selenium` 
framework.

## Prerequisites

- Google Chrome browser.

### Install ChromeDriver via NPM

Download and install [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) to get `npm` commands in your command line tool, and then
run the following command:

`npm install chromedriver`
