This is a **demo** project to showcase how to perform End-To-End testing using the `Selenium` 
framework.

## Requirements

### IDEs

- [IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/#section=windows) (recommended)
- [Eclipse](http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/)

### Dependencies

- Download [Selenium](http://www.seleniumhq.org/download/).
- Setup TestNG with your IDE and project ([IntelliJ IDEA setup](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/configuring-testing-libraries.html)
/ [Eclipse plugin](http://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/testng-eclipse))
- ChromeDriver (the easiest way to install it is via `npm`)

#### Install ChromeDriver via NPM

Download and install [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) to get `npm` commands in your command line tool, and then
run the following command:

`npm install chromedriver`

If you are a Mac OS X user with Homebrew installed, you can also use:

`brew install chromedriver`
